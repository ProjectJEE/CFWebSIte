# CFWebSIte
BulbCrowding project in Java EE. Group: ROUINEB Hamza,AMZIL Fatima, NAJI Ibtissam.

In this phase, we've configured the Spring framework, the apache tiles framework for the backend logic
and bootstrap twitter framwork, owl carousel framework and jquery for the frontend logic. 
Since we started working on the view side (I mean the jsp files), we're tweaking all together some aspects 
that needs each one of us to be present .. (you know to have different toughts which is always good)
we've been working on this since the first day .. all that is left is the view side .. !

hope you like it ..
